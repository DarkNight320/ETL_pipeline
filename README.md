# Java Backend Samples (Full)

This repository contains fully implemented Java examples demonstrating:

- REST API client service using Java 17 HttpClient and Jackson
- AWS S3 integration using AWS SDK v2 (S3Client)
- A simple ETL pipeline that reads CSV, transforms data, and writes output
- Unit tests with JUnit 5
- Maven build configuration

**Note:** To run the S3 examples you need AWS credentials configured (e.g., via `~/.aws/credentials`) and a valid S3 bucket.
